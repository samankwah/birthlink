firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy authentication configuration  
firebase deploy --only auth
```

#### 2.3 Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test deployed application
# Check PWA installation
# Verify offline functionality
# Test authentication flows
# Validate birth registration process
```

### Step 3: Monitoring & Analytics Setup (Week 2)

#### 3.1 Firebase Analytics
```javascript
// Already configured in firebase.ts
// Enable in Firebase Console:
// - Google Analytics integration
// - Performance monitoring
// - Crashlytics (if needed)
```

#### 3.2 Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Set up performance alerts
# Monitor Core Web Vitals
# Track offline sync success rates
# Monitor PWA installation rates
```

#### 3.3 User Analytics Dashboard
```bash
# Configure Firebase Analytics events:
# - Birth registration completions
# - Offline registrations created
# - Sync success/failure rates
# - User role distribution
